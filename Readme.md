Hi, I'm Harshdeep — a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about building scalable, high-performance web applications and experimenting with AI-driven solutions.

I focus on creating clean user interfaces, efficient backend systems, and seamless integrations that bridge creativity with functionality.

### Currently exploring:

- Advanced backend patterns with **Node.js** and **Express**
- AI-powered product features using **OpenAI APIs**
- Database design and deployment optimization with **MongoDB** and **Vercel**

My development philosophy is simple — **write purposeful code, ship meaningful products, and keep learning every day.**

When I'm not coding, I'm usually refining my learning path, contributing to open-source projects, or helping others get started with modern web technologies.
